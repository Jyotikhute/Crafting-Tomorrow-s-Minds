                    primary (11 and 12), high (13 to 15) and higher secondary (17 and 18). The lower primary school is

                    secondary into two.

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">India, with its diversity fascinates one and all. Indian Education has
                recently gained world recognition. Many students from foreign countries are eyeing the country for
                gaining higher qualifications. Though, illiteracy is a problem in India, the country amazes outsiders
                with its vast pool of talent. In a country as large as India, now with 28 states and eight union
                territories, this means that the potential for variations between states in the policies, plans,
                programs and initiatives for elementary education is vast. Periodically, national policy frameworks are
                created to guide states in their creation of state-level programs and policies. State governments and
                local government bodies manage the majority of primary and upper primary schools and the number of
                government-managed elementary schools is growing. Simultaneously the number and proportion managed by
                private bodies is growing.

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">The Indian economy has grown in leaps and bounds in the recent years and
                hence there is a necessity to educate the masses to accelerate the growth process. It is interesting to
                note how the Indian education machinery works.Education is one of the most important aspects in life. It
                helps in the personal development as well as social and economic development of the nation. Moreover, it
                helps in understanding social justice, rights and laws of an individual.

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education in India is matter of prime concern for the government of
                India. The
                University Grants Commission (UGC) coordinates, determines and maintains the standards of education
                at various levels. There are many professional bodies, which are responsible for accreditations of
                the courses, as well as providing grants to the different undergraduate courses.Although there are
                private schools in India, they are highly regulated in terms of what they can teach, in what form they
                can operate (must be a non-profit to run any accredited educational institution) and all the other
                aspects of the operation. Hence, the differentiation between government schools and private schools can
                be misleading.[21] However, in a report by Geeta Gandhi Kingdon entitled: The emptying of public Schools
                and growth of private schools in India, it is said that For sensible education policy making, it is
                vital to take account of the changing trends in the size of the private and public schooling sectors in
                India.</p>
